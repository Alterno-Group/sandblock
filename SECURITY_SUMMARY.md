## Real-World Attack Simulation Results

### Scenario 1: Attacker with 200,000 USDT
**Goal**: Drain contract containing 250,000 USDT

**Attempted Attacks**:
1. ❌ Claim other investors' interest → **BLOCKED**
2. ❌ Claim other investors' principal → **BLOCKED**
3. ❌ Claim without investment → **BLOCKED**
4. ❌ Reentrancy attack during claim → **BLOCKED**
5. ❌ Direct USDT transfer from contract → **BLOCKED**
6. ❌ Claim before time delay → **BLOCKED**

**Result**: Attacker gains **ZERO USDT** ✅

### Scenario 2: Malicious Investor
**Goal**: Claim more than entitled amount

**Attempted Attacks**:
1. ❌ Double-claim interest → **BLOCKED**
2. ❌ Double-claim principal → **BLOCKED**
3. ❌ Claim before time period → **BLOCKED**
4. ❌ Over-claim beyond 20% → **BLOCKED**

**Result**: Investor can only claim **exact entitled amount** ✅

### Scenario 3: Project Owner Exploitation
**Goal**: Steal invested funds

**Reality Check**:
- Project owner has NO function to withdraw invested funds
- Funds released to investors automatically via claims
- Project owner cannot modify investor balances
- Project owner cannot bypass claim schedules

**Result**: Project owner **CANNOT steal funds** ✅
