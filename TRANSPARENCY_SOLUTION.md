# ✅ SandBlock: Fully Transparent Off-Ramp/On-Ramp Solution

## The Problem You Asked About ❓

**Your Question:** "The investor want off-ramp/on-ramp transparent, your flow can do that?"

**Answer:** YES! I've built a **fully transparent** on-chain system where every single transaction is recorded and auditable by ALL investors.

## What Makes It Transparent? 💎

### ❌ Old Way (Opaque):
```
Investor sees: $1M in contract
Next day: $800k in contract
Investor: "Where did $200k go???" 😰
```

### ✅ New Way (Transparent):
```
Investor sees:
- $200k withdrawn on Jan 15, 2024
- Used for: "Solar panel purchase from SolarTech Inc"
- Converted to: $199,000 USD
- Sent to bank: ****5678
- Exchange rate: 0.995
- Provider: Circle
- Transaction ref: circle_tx_abc123
- Status: ✅ Completed
```

| **Provider** | Who processed it | Circle | Trusted party |
| **Purpose** | What it's for | "Solar panel purchase" | Proves legitimate use |

    string provider,         // "Circle", "Coinbase"
    string purpose,          // "Solar panels purchase"

    string source,           // "Energy sales - Jan 2024"
    string invoiceNumber     // "INV-2024-001"
) external;
