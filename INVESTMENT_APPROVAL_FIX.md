# Investment Approval Fix - ERC20: insufficient allowance

## Problem

Users were getting the error **"ERC20: insufficient allowance"** when trying to invest in projects. This is a standard ERC20 token issue that occurs when a smart contract tries to transfer tokens on behalf of a user without proper approval.

## Root Cause

When investing in a SandBlock project:
1. User has USDT tokens in their wallet
2. SandBlock contract needs permission to transfer those tokens
3. Without approval, the `transferFrom()` call in the smart contract fails with "ERC20: insufficient allowance"

This is a **security feature** of ERC20 tokens - contracts cannot spend your tokens without explicit permission.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Two-Step Transaction Flow**

The investment process now works in two steps:

**Step 1: Approve USDT Spending**
```typescript
// Check if approval is needed
const currentAllowance = allowance || 0n;
if (currentAllowance < amountInUSDT) {
  await approveUSDT({
    args: [hubAddress, amountInUSDT],
  });
}
```

**Step 2: Invest in Project**
```typescript
// After approval completes, invest
await invest({
  args: [BigInt(projectId), amountInUSDT],
});
```

### 2. **Real-time Approval Status**

Added a `needsApproval` state that tracks whether approval is required:

```typescript
const [needsApproval, setNeedsApproval] = useState(false);

// Check if approval is needed when amount changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (investAmount && hubAddress) {
    try {
      const amountInUSDT = parseUnits(investAmount, 6);
      const currentAllowance = allowance || 0n;
      setNeedsApproval(currentAllowance < amountInUSDT);
    } catch {
      setNeedsApproval(false);
    }
  } else {
    setNeedsApproval(false);
  }
}, [investAmount, allowance, hubAddress]);
```

### 3. **Visual Feedback**

#### Button Text Changes Based on State:
- **"Approve & Invest"** - When approval is needed
- **"Approving USDT..."** - During approval transaction
- **"Investing..."** - During investment transaction
- **"Invest"** - When already approved

#### Info Box for Approval:
When approval is needed, users see a blue info box explaining:
```
Token Approval Required

You'll need to approve the SandBlock contract to spend your USDT tokens.
This is a one-time transaction that will be followed by the investment transaction.
```

### 4. **Enhanced Error Messages**

Added specific error handling for approval issues:

```typescript
if (
  error.message.includes("insufficient allowance") ||
  error.message.includes("ERC20: insufficient allowance")
) {
  errorMsg = "Token approval failed or is insufficient. Please try again and approve the transaction.";
}
```

## How It Works Now

### User Experience:

1. **User enters investment amount**
   - System checks current USDT allowance
   - If allowance < amount, shows "Token Approval Required" info box
   - Button changes to "Approve & Invest"

2. **User clicks "Approve & Invest"**
   - First transaction: Approve USDT spending
   - User confirms in wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
   - Button shows "Approving USDT..."
   - Wait for approval to complete

3. **Approval completes**
   - Second transaction: Invest in project
   - User confirms in wallet again
   - Button shows "Investing..."
   - Wait for investment to complete

4. **Investment successful**
   - Modal closes
   - User's investment is recorded
   - Project funding updated

### Technical Flow:

```
User Wallet (USDT)
       ↓
   [Approval Transaction]
       ↓
SandBlock Contract gets permission
       ↓
   [Investment Transaction]
       ↓
USDT transferred from User → SandBlock Contract
       ↓
Investment recorded on-chain
```

## Code Changes

### File: `packages/frontend/components/energy/InvestmentModal.tsx`

#### Added State:
```typescript
const [needsApproval, setNeedsApproval] = useState(false);
```

#### Added useEffect:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (investAmount && hubAddress) {
    try {
      const amountInUSDT = parseUnits(investAmount, 6);
      const currentAllowance = allowance || 0n;
      setNeedsApproval(currentAllowance < amountInUSDT);
    } catch {
      setNeedsApproval(false);
    }
  } else {
    setNeedsApproval(false);
  }
}, [investAmount, allowance, hubAddress]);
```

#### Enhanced handleInvest:
```typescript
const handleInvest = async () => {
  if (!investAmount || !projectData || projectId === null || !hubAddress) return;

  setErrorMessage("");

  try {
    const amountInUSDT = parseUnits(investAmount, 6);
    const currentAllowance = allowance || 0n;

    // Step 1: Approve if needed
    if (currentAllowance < amountInUSDT) {
      console.log("Approving USDT spending...");
      await approveUSDT({
        args: [hubAddress, amountInUSDT],
      });
      console.log("Approval transaction completed");
    }

    // Step 2: Invest
    console.log("Investing in project...");
    await invest({
      args: [BigInt(projectId), amountInUSDT],
    });

    console.log("Investment successful!");
    setInvestAmount("");
    onClose();
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Enhanced error handling
  }
};
```

#### Added UI Elements:
```tsx
{/* Approval Info Box */}
{needsApproval && investAmount && numInvestAmount > 0 && (
  <div className="mt-3 p-3 sm:p-4 bg-blue-500/10 border border-blue-500/20 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-start gap-2">
      <svg>...</svg>
      <div className="flex-1">
        <p className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-500">Token Approval Required</p>
        <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-1">
          You&apos;ll need to approve the SandBlock contract to spend your USDT tokens.
          This is a one-time transaction that will be followed by the investment transaction.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Updated Button:
```tsx
<button onClick={handleInvest} disabled={...}>
  {!canInvest
    ? "Cannot Invest"
    : isApproving
    ? "Approving USDT..."
    : isInvesting
    ? "Investing..."
    : needsApproval
    ? "Approve & Invest"
    : "Invest"}
</button>
```

## Testing Guide

### Test the fix:

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Switch to liskSepolia network
   - Connect your wallet

2. **Get USDT**
   - Click "Faucet" button to get test USDT
   - Or mint directly from MockUSDT contract

3. **Try to Invest**
   - Browse to a project
   - Click "Invest in This Project"
   - Enter amount (e.g., 100 USDT)

4. **Check for Approval Info**
   - Should see blue "Token Approval Required" box
   - Button should say "Approve & Invest"

5. **Click "Approve & Invest"**
   - First wallet popup: Approve USDT spending
   - Confirm transaction
   - Wait for approval to complete
   - Second wallet popup: Invest in project
   - Confirm transaction
   - Wait for investment to complete

6. **Verify Success**
   - Modal should close
   - Investment should be recorded
   - Project funding should increase

### Expected Wallet Transactions:

**Transaction 1: Approve**
- To: MockUSDT Contract
- Function: `approve(spender, amount)`
- Gas: ~50,000

**Transaction 2: Invest**
- To: SandBlock Contract
- Function: `investInProject(projectId, amount)`
- Gas: ~150,000

## Why Two Transactions?

This is a **standard ERC20 pattern** for security:

1. **Security**: Prevents contracts from spending your tokens without permission
2. **User Control**: You explicitly approve how much can be spent
3. **Flexibility**: You can approve once and make multiple investments
4. **Standard Practice**: Used by Uniswap, Aave, Compound, and all major DeFi protocols

## Optimization: Unlimited Approval

**Future Enhancement**: We could offer users the option to approve unlimited amount (type(uint256).max):

```typescript
// Instead of approving exact amount:
await approveUSDT({
  args: [hubAddress, amountInUSDT], // Current: exact amount
});

// Could approve unlimited (one-time approval for all future investments):
await approveUSDT({
  args: [hubAddress, BigInt("115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935")], // Max uint256
});
```

**Pros**: Only one approval transaction ever needed
**Cons**: Security risk if contract is compromised

Most DeFi apps give users the choice. We could add a checkbox:
```
☐ Approve unlimited USDT (no future approvals needed)
```
