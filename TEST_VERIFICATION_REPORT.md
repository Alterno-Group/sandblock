## Critical Bug Fixes

### Bug #1: Principal Calculation Timing Error (FIXED)

**Issue**: The contract was calculating years elapsed from the investment time instead of from the principal payback start time (funding completion + 2 years).

**Impact**: Returning 3x the expected amount (60,000 USDT instead of 20,000 USDT)

**Root Cause**:
```solidity
// OLD - INCORRECT
uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - investment.lastPrincipalClaim;
// This used investment time, not payback start time
```

**Solution**:
```solidity
// NEW - CORRECT
uint256 principalPaybackStartTime = project.fundingCompletedAt + PRINCIPAL_PAYBACK_DELAY;
uint256 effectiveLastClaim = investment.lastPrincipalClaim > principalPaybackStartTime
    ? investment.lastPrincipalClaim
    : principalPaybackStartTime;
uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - effectiveLastClaim;
```

**Files Modified**:
- [EnergyProjectHub.sol:354-401](packages/hardhat/contracts/EnergyProjectHub.sol#L354-L401) - `calculateAvailablePrincipal()`
- [EnergyProjectHub.sol:427-460](packages/hardhat/contracts/EnergyProjectHub.sol#L427-L460) - `claimPrincipal()`

---

## Interest Calculation Formula

```solidity
Annual Interest = Principal × Rate ÷ 10,000
Weekly Interest = Annual Interest ÷ 52
Total Interest = Weekly Interest × Weeks Elapsed
```

**Example** (Tier 2 - 7% APY):
```
Principal: 10,000 USDT
Rate: 700 basis points (7%)
Annual Interest = 10,000 × 700 ÷ 10,000 = 700 USDT/year
Weekly Interest = 700 ÷ 52 = 13.461538 USDT/week
```

---

## Principal Payback Formula

```solidity
Principal Payback Start = Funding Completed + 2 years
Effective Last Claim = max(Principal Payback Start, Last Claim Time)
Years Elapsed = (Current Time - Effective Last Claim) ÷ 365 days
Annual Payback = Principal × 20%
Total Payback = Annual Payback × Years Elapsed
```

**Example**:
```
Principal: 100,000 USDT
Funding Completed: T0
Principal Payback Start: T0 + 2 years
Current Time: T0 + 3 years

Years Elapsed = (T0 + 3 years) - (T0 + 2 years) = 1 year
Annual Payback = 100,000 × 0.20 = 20,000 USDT
Total Payback = 20,000 × 1 = 20,000 USDT ✅
```
