# **Privacy Policy — SANDBLŌCK**

**Last updated:** 26/12/2025

SANDBLŌCK (“**SANDBLŌCK**”, “**we**”, “**us**”) provides a web application that allows users to view project information and interact with blockchain-based smart contracts. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our website and services (the “**Service**”).

## **1\. Information We Collect**

We collect only the information reasonably necessary to operate and improve the Service:

**A) Information you provide**

* Contact details you submit (e.g., email) when you request support or updates.

**B) Blockchain information**

* Public blockchain addresses and transaction data you submit or generate when interacting with smart contracts.  
   *Note: Blockchain data is public and may be accessible to anyone.*

**C) Technical and usage information**

* Device and browser information, IP address, approximate location (city/country level), log data, and usage analytics (e.g., pages visited, actions taken).

**D) Cookies and similar technologies**

* We may use cookies or similar tools for basic functionality, security, and analytics.

## **2\. How We Use Information**

We use information to:

* Provide, maintain, and secure the Service

* Enable smart contract interactions and display relevant on-chain information

* Monitor performance, troubleshoot, and improve user experience

* Communicate with you regarding support requests or important service updates

* Prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents

## **3\. How We Share Information**

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information with:

* **Service providers** (e.g., hosting, analytics) strictly for operating the Service

* **Payment/on-ramp providers** you choose to use, to facilitate transactions (subject to their own policies)

* **Legal and safety**: if required by law, regulation, or valid legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security

## **4\. Data Retention**

We retain information only for as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a longer retention period is required by law or needed for legitimate business purposes (e.g., security, dispute resolution).

## **5\. Security**

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards. However, no online service is completely secure, and you use the Service at your own risk.

## **6\. Your Choices**

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete certain information. Note that we cannot delete or modify data recorded on a public blockchain.

## **7\. Third-Party Services**

The Service may link to third-party websites or services (including on-ramp providers). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies, not ours.

## **8\. International Users**

Your information may be processed in countries where we or our service providers operate. We take steps to protect data consistent with this Policy.
