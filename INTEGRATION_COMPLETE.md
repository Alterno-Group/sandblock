## 🎯 What Has Been Accomplished

### 1. Smart Contract Implementation ✅

**File**: `packages/hardhat/contracts/SandBlock.sol`

**New Features Added**:
- **Off-Ramp Transaction Tracking** (USDT → Fiat for construction)
  - Records every withdrawal with full details
  - Tracks: amount, exchange rate, provider, purpose, bank account, transaction hash
  - Immutable on-chain records

- **On-Ramp Transaction Tracking** (Fiat → USDT for investor payments)
  - Records every revenue deposit
  - Tracks: fiat amount, USDT amount, exchange rate, provider, source, invoice number
  - Complete audit trail

**Smart Contract Functions**:
```solidity
// Off-Ramp (Withdraw for construction)
function initiateOffRamp(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _usdtAmount, uint256 _fiatAmount, string memory _provider, string memory _purpose, string memory _bankAccount)
function completeOffRamp(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _transactionIndex, string memory _txHash)
function getOffRampTransactions(uint256 _projectId) returns (OffRampTransaction[])

// On-Ramp (Deposit revenue)
function initiateOnRamp(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _fiatAmount, uint256 _usdtAmount, string memory _provider, string memory _source, string memory _invoiceNumber)
function completeOnRamp(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _transactionIndex, string memory _txHash)
function getOnRampTransactions(uint256 _projectId) returns (OnRampTransaction[])

// Financial Summary
function getFinancialSummary(uint256 _projectId) returns (totalInvested, totalOffRamped, totalOnRamped, offRampCount, onRampCount, netBalance)
```

**Deployment**:
- ✅ Compiled successfully (3,795,113 gas)
